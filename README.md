## Overview

- Very simple App for money management . Stack: Node.js, TypeScript , Vite, React, MobX, Electron.

## Installation

```bash
# clone the project
git clone http://gitlab.local/root/my-money-app-project.git

# open the project directory
cd my-money-app-project

# install dependencies
npm install or yarn install

# start the application
npm run dev or yarn dev

# make a production build
npm run build or yarn build
```

## Directory structure

Once `dev` or `build` npm-script is executed, the `dist` folder will be generated. It has the same structure as the `packages` folder, the purpose of this design is to ensure the correct path calculation.

```tree
â”œ
â”œâ”€â”€ build                     Resources for the production build
â”œ   â”œâ”€â”€ icon.icns             Icon for the application on macOS
â”œ   â”œâ”€â”€ icon.ico              Icon for the application
â”œ   â”œâ”€â”€ installerIcon.ico     Icon for the application installer
â”œ   â”œâ”€â”€ uninstallerIcon.ico   Icon for the application uninstaller
â”œ
â”œâ”€â”€ dist                      Generated after build according to the "packages" directory
â”œ   â”œâ”€â”€ main
â”œ   â”œâ”€â”€ preload
â”œ   â”œâ”€â”€ renderer
â”œ
â”œâ”€â”€ release                   Generated after production build, contains executables
â”œ   â”œâ”€â”€ {version}
â”œ       â”œâ”€â”€ win-unpacked      Contains unpacked application executable
â”œ       â”œâ”€â”€ Setup.exe         Installer for the application
â”œ
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts
â”œ   â”œâ”€â”€ build.mjs             Develop script -> npm run build
â”œ   â”œâ”€â”€ watch.mjs             Develop script -> npm run dev
â”œ
â”œâ”€â”€ packages
â”œ   â”œâ”€â”€ main                  Main-process source code
â”œ       â”œâ”€â”€ vite.config.ts
â”œ   â”œâ”€â”€ preload               Preload-script source code
â”œ       â”œâ”€â”€ vite.config.ts
â”œ   â”œâ”€â”€ renderer              Renderer-process source code
â”œ       â”œâ”€â”€ vite.config.ts
â”œ
```

## Use Electron and NodeJS API

> ðŸš§ By default, Electron doesn't support the use of API related to Electron and NodeJS in the Renderer process, but someone might need to use it. If so, you can see the template ðŸ‘‰ **[electron-vite-boilerplate](https://github.com/caoxiemeihao/electron-vite-boilerplate)**

#### Invoke Electron and NodeJS API in `Preload-script`

- **packages/preload/index.ts**

    ```typescript
    import fs from "fs"
    import { contextBridge, ipcRenderer } from "electron"

    // --------- Expose some API to Renderer-process. ---------
    contextBridge.exposeInMainWorld("fs", fs)
    contextBridge.exposeInMainWorld("ipcRenderer", ipcRenderer)
    ```

- **packages/renderer/src/global.d.ts**

    ```typescript
    // Defined in the window
    interface Window {
      fs: typeof import("fs")
      ipcRenderer: import("electron").IpcRenderer
    }
    ```

- **packages/renderer/src/main.ts**

    ```typescript
    // Use Electron and NodeJS API in the Renderer-process
    console.log("fs", window.fs)
    console.log("ipcRenderer", window.ipcRenderer)
    ```

## Use SerialPort, SQLite3, or other node-native addons in the Main-process

- First, you need to make sure that the dependencies in the `package.json` are NOT in the "devDependencies". Because the project will need them after packaged.

- Main-process, Preload-script are also built with Vite, and they're built as [build.lib](https://vitejs.dev/config/#build-lib).  
    So they just need to configure Rollup.

**Click to see more** ðŸ‘‰ [packages/main/vite.config.ts](https://github.com/caoxiemeihao/vite-react-electron/blob/main/packages/main/vite.config.ts)

```js
export default {
  build: {
    // built lib for Main-process, Preload-script
    lib: {
      entry: "index.ts",
      formats: ["cjs"],
      fileName: () => "[name].js",
    },
    rollupOptions: {
      // configuration here
      external: ["serialport", "sqlite3"],
    },
  },
}
```

## `dependencies` vs `devDependencies`

- First, you need to know if your dependencies are needed after the application is packaged.

- Like [serialport](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serialport), [sqlite3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sqlite3) they are node-native modules and should be placed in `dependencies`. In addition, Vite will not build them, but treat them as external modules.

- Dependencies like [Vue](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue) and [React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react), which are pure javascript modules that can be built with Vite, can be placed in `devDependencies`. This reduces the size of the application.
